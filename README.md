# Two-Steps-GVF-Snake-Model-Image-segmentation

Active contours, or snakes, are widely used in medical image processing applications, mainly to locate the desired area
boundaries. Gradient vector flow (GVF) field, like other methods of calculating external force fields, is proposed to
address ordinary snake models’ problems, such as poor convergence in indentations and low accuracy in segmentation
of objects owned weak borders. These problems are most pronounced in high-noise images, such as ultrasound
images. In order to solve the problems more, we utilized the generalized gradient vector flow snake model using
minimal surface and two steps converging using both vector based normalization and component-based normalization
with distinct controlling parameters on active contour. We adopt minimal surface function to address the problem of
low segmentation accuracy in other conventional methods. We also use two steps converging using both vector-based
and component-based normalization with distinct controlling parameters to improve the snake curve converging into
long and thin indentations plus higher accuracy in noisy and meandering areas. The results obtained and compared
with other methods show that the proposed active contour model not only can converge better into long and thin
indentations, along with maintaining weak boundaries but also shows higher accuracy in segmentation of tortuous
areas, especially in noisy images.
